# The Name of God in the Abrahamic Faiths

We’ll dive into a fascinating topic that lies at the heart of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: the name of God and the deep linguistic and spiritual ties across these Abrahamic religions.

The words we use for God in these faiths might seem distinct, but they’re all connected by shared roots in ancient Semitic languages—languages that have shaped these religious traditions for thousands of years. We’re going to explore three primary languages here: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. Each holds a unique place in the history of these faiths but shares something profound when it comes to describing the divine.

### Semitic Language Roots and God’s Name

Let’s start with these languages themselves. Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic are all part of the Semitic language family. Hebrew is the oldest, central to Judaism and its sacred texts. Then we have Aramaic, which, for centuries, was widely spoken across the Near East and influenced early Judaism and Christianity. Finally, Arabic—the most recent of the three—is the language of the Quran in Islam.

These languages share common linguistic roots Let’s look at each language and how it names God.

### The Name of God in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic

- In **Aramaic**, the word for God is **“Alaha”**—that’s ܐܠܗܐ in the Syriac script. And in addition to Alaha, other Aramaic terms, like **Elah** and **Elaha**, also refer to God. In fact, the word “Alaha” is what Jesus himself would have used, reflecting the very essence of divinity.

- Moving to **Hebrew**, we have the word **“Elohim.”** Just like in Aramaic, this term emphasizes strength and supremacy. You can see it in names like Israel, which means “God strives,”. Elohim have been central to Jewish texts for thousands of years and speak to the very character of God in the Jewish faith.

- Then in **Arabic**, we have **“Allah.”** This term, closely related to the Aramaic Alaha and Hebrew Elohim, is central to Islam. The name Allah emphasizes God’s oneness and absolute power, a core concept in Islamic theology. 

When we look at these terms together—Alaha, Elohim, and Allah—we see a deep, shared history. It’s amazing how, across languages and faiths, these names connect so strongly.

For over five hundred years before the birth of Muhammad, Arab Christians and even some Jews in the Arabian peninsula used the word Allah for God. Roughly twenty million Arab Christians do so today. In fact, when Jesus spoke about God in everyday conversation, he would have used the same Aramaic word that every other Aramaic-speaker used: Alaha.

The Quran and the Testament were in agreement about many things indeed, including the God who had inspired their text.

### Shared Terminology in Aramaic and Arabic

Now, there are other words that reflect shared meanings between Aramaic and Arabic. One example is `Shalem` used in  the Peshitta . - Hebrew: `Shalom`. Arabic: `Salaam`. Aramaic: `Shalem`.
- Shalem: submit to God. also means: be at peace. Shalem: be surren-
dered. 
- Mu shalem (Mu-shalem.)= one who is surrendered.
- In Arabic Muslim= one who is surrendered.

Islam and Christianity were not simply overlapping ideas. They were not merely compatible. In the most central sense, they were one continuum. 
Islam is the total submission to God which is the core message of Jesus Christ and his followers.
The Qur’an says, "`The religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His will`).” 3:19

Christianity was not intended by its founder as a new religion,
with strict rules, regulations, structures, and hierarchies, but as a continuity with and recovery of the essence of the old one. And
the exact same thing is true of Islam.

They were intended as movements, peaceful revolutions of the human heart. And they had an identical mission and agenda, right down to the very words: Repent and be converted. Submit to God. Be at peace. Be one—“mu”—who is surrendered—“shalem.” Mu-shalem. Muslim.

No wonder the Qur’an declared that Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were all Muslims. So, in the sense of the fundamental meaning of the word, are all **practicing** Christians and Jews.

### Misconceptions about the Term “God”

Let’s also address a common misconception: the English term **“God.”** When we think of “God” in English, we might assume it directly refers to the Almighty in Abrahamic faiths. But, interestingly, **“God”** in English doesn’t come from these Semitic roots. Instead, it originates from a proto-Germanic root, **“gott,”** which referred to a type of water spirit in pagan traditions. 

Likewise, in Latin, **“Deus”**—which gives us **“deity”** in English, as well as **“Dios”** in Spanish and **“Dieu”** in French—is actually related to **“Zeus,”** the chief god in the Greek pantheon. These terms reflect cultural interpretations of divinity rather than the specific monotheistic concept in Abrahamic faiths. 

So, the term “God” or “Deus” doesn’t quite capture the unique spiritual meaning of **“Alaha,”** **“Elohim,”** or **“Allah.”** These Semitic names, rooted in a concept of a singular, powerful deity, hold a distinct identity and legacy in the Abrahamic religions.

### Conclusion: A Shared Legacy of God’s Name

In conclusion, these names—Alaha, Elohim, and Allah—go beyond mere words. They carry history, culture, and a shared understanding of God’s singular nature across the Abrahamic faiths. The linguistic connections between Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic reveal just how intertwined these traditions are, reflecting common beliefs even through different expressions.

Understanding this shared heritage brings a richer perspective. It shows us that, despite the differences in how each faith expresses divinity, there’s a profound unity in the way God’s nature is understood. It deepens our respect for the diverse ways we honor the divine.

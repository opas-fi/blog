# The main themes in the holy Quran, the old testament, the new testament

1. It it so that the main themes in the holy Quran are
  - Monotheism and Creed 
  - The The Unseen (e.g., the belief in Allah and His qualities, as well as angels, resurrection, judgment, etc.), which reaffirms one’s faith in the divine through one’s heart, not eyes.
  - Law/Doctrine e.g., acts of worship, human interactions, family relations, and business transactions, which focuses mainly on a Muslim’s relationship with Allah, other people, and the rest of Allah’s creation.
  - Stories e.g., 
    a. the story of Moses, Noah, and Ṣâliḥ, which served two purposes: to reassure the Prophet’s heart, as he was met with rejection in Mecca, and as cautionary tales for the pagans (see 11:120-123).
    b. Other stories (e.g., Joseph and Job) focus on moral lessons.
2. Are these themes covered in the old testament?
3. Are these themes covered in the new testament: Peshitta, Catholic, Protestant?

1. **Themes in the Holy Quran:**

Yes, the themes you mentioned are indeed central in the Quran:

- **Monotheism and Creed (Tawhid):** The belief in the oneness of Allah is a fundamental theme of the Quran. It repeatedly emphasizes the unity of Allah and the rejection of any form of polytheism or association with Him. This theme forms the core of Islamic theology and is present in every chapter of the Quran.

- **The Unseen (Iman):** The Quran speaks extensively about the unseen realm, including belief in Allah, angels, the Day of Judgment, resurrection, and other spiritual realities that are beyond human perception. These beliefs are seen as essential to a Muslim's faith, with emphasis on internal conviction rather than sensory proof (belief in the unseen).

- **Law/Doctrine (Shariah):** The Quran provides comprehensive guidance on personal and social conduct, addressing topics such as acts of worship (e.g., prayer, fasting, charity), family relations (e.g., marriage, inheritance), business ethics (e.g., honesty, contracts), and other moral and legal principles. It lays out how Muslims should relate to Allah, fellow humans, and the rest of creation.

- **Stories of Prophets and Moral Lessons:** The Quran contains numerous stories of past prophets, such as Moses, Noah, and Ṣâliḥ. These stories often serve to offer comfort and assurance to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and provide moral guidance for the followers of Islam. They are meant to highlight lessons about patience, perseverance, faith, and the consequences of rejecting divine guidance. Stories like those of Joseph and Job also offer moral and spiritual lessons related to suffering, trust in God, and patience in adversity.

2. **Coverage of These Themes in the Old Testament:**

The Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) covers some of these themes but with differences in emphasis and presentation. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Monotheism and Creed:** The Old Testament emphasizes monotheism, particularly in texts like the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"). However, the concept of God in the Old Testament is somewhat different from the strict Islamic concept of Tawhid, as the Jewish tradition has more room for understanding God's nature in a variety of ways (e.g., God's revelation through different names, the presence of the divine spirit, etc.).

- **The Unseen:** Belief in the unseen is present in the Old Testament, but it is often less explicitly developed than in the Quran. For example, belief in angels, the afterlife, and judgment is found in the Old Testament, though it is less emphasized compared to the Quran. The focus in the Old Testament is more on the tangible relationship between God and His people.

- **Law/Doctrine:** The Old Testament is filled with legal and moral teachings, especially in books like Leviticus, Exodus, and Deuteronomy, which provide detailed laws on religious observance, personal conduct, and social justice. These laws, however, are specific to the covenant between God and the Israelites and may differ in some respects from Islamic teachings.

- **Stories and Moral Lessons:** The Old Testament contains many stories of prophets (e.g., Moses, Noah, Job) that align with the Quranic portrayal, though there are differences in details and theological interpretation. These stories serve to teach moral lessons about faith, obedience, and trust in God, similar to how the Quran uses the stories of past prophets.

3. **Coverage of These Themes in the New Testament (Peshitta, Catholic, Protestant):**

The New Testament, across all major Christian traditions (Catholic, Protestant, and Peshitta), shares some of the themes outlined in the Quran, though there are notable differences in focus and theological interpretation:

- **Monotheism and Creed:** Christianity emphasizes the concept of the Trinity (God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) is central to most Christian denominations. This is a significant departure from the Islamic understanding of the oneness of God, which does not accommodate the Trinitarian doctrine.

- **The Unseen:** The New Testament mentions belief in the unseen in various ways, particularly through teachings about faith, the afterlife, angels, and the coming of the Kingdom of God. However, the focus is often on the revelation of God through Jesus Christ and the role of faith in Him. The concept of the unseen is developed differently than in the Quran, with a stronger focus on Christ as the mediator between God and humanity.

- **Law/Doctrine:** The New Testament has teachings about law, ethics, and moral behavior, particularly through the teachings of Jesus (e.g., the Sermon on the Mount) and the apostolic letters (e.g., Paul's epistles). While there are moral guidelines, the focus is more on grace, faith in Jesus, and the transformation of the heart rather than on the strict legal codes found in the Quran and the Old Testament.

- **Stories and Moral Lessons:** The New Testament contains many stories, especially the parables of Jesus and accounts of His life, death, and resurrection. These stories convey moral and spiritual lessons, similar to the stories of the prophets in the Quran. The New Testament also discusses the lives of early Christians and apostles, emphasizing themes of sacrifice, love, and forgiveness.

### Key Differences:

- **Trinity in Christianity:** Christianity's belief in the Trinity is a major difference from Islam, which insists on the absolute oneness (Tawhid) of God.
  
- **Prophet Jesus (Isa) in Christianity vs. Islam:** In the New Testament, Jesus is the central figure and is seen as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity, whereas in Islam, Jesus (Isa) is considered a prophet and servant of God, not divine.

- **Law and Grace:** Christianity emphasizes salvation through grace and faith in Jesus Christ, while the Quran emphasizes both faith and following God's law (Shariah).

In summary, the themes you mentioned are present in both the Old and New Testaments, but they are expressed in different theological and doctrinal frameworks. The Quran's emphasis on strict monotheism, the unseen, legal guidance, and prophetic stories provides a distinctive approach compared to the Jewish and Christian scriptures.

Q. Does the term bibble refer to old testament and new testament i.e. is it so, that  Tanakh is bible and peshitta is bible

A.

The term "Bible" is a general term used to describe the sacred scriptures of different religious traditions, and it is not restricted to the Old and New Testaments. Here's how the *Tanakh*, the *Peshitta*, and other collections fit into the broader understanding of "Bible":

### 1. **Tanakh as "Bible"**
   - The *Tanakh* is the canonical collection of Jewish scriptures, consisting of the Torah (Law), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings). It corresponds to what Christians refer to as the "Old Testament," though there are differences in arrangement and interpretation.
   - For Jews, the *Tanakh* is **the Bible**—the foundational text of Judaism.

### 2. **Peshitta as "Bible"**
   - The *Peshitta* is the Syriac translation of the Bible. It serves as the standard Bible for many Syriac-speaking Christian traditions.
     - For Old Testament books, it is based on texts similar to the Hebrew *Tanakh* but also incorporates elements from the Greek Septuagint.
     - For the New Testament, the *Peshitta* includes most of the books recognized in Christian canons but has some textual differences, such as the exclusion of certain books (e.g., 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation in some traditions).

### 3. **Bible as a General Term**
   - The term "Bible" refers broadly to a collection of sacred scriptures deemed authoritative within a religious tradition. Thus:
     - For Christians, the Bible generally includes both the Old Testament (derived from the *Tanakh*) and the New Testament.
     - For Jews, the Bible is the *Tanakh*.
     - For Syriac Christians, the *Peshitta* is their Bible, encompassing both the Old and New Testaments in the Syriac tradition.

### Conclusion
Yes, both the *Tanakh* and the *Peshitta* are "Bibles," but they serve different religious traditions and have distinct contents and languages. The term "Bible" is context-dependent and reflects the scripture collection recognized as sacred and authoritative by a specific religious community.

Q. How many dialects in Aramaic. is it so that Galilean Aramaic is more important than classical Syriac Aramaic

A. 
Aramaic, a Semitic language with a history spanning over 3,000 years, has numerous dialects, categorized broadly into several groups based on geography, time period, and linguistic features. The importance of a particular dialect, such as Galilean Aramaic versus Classical Syriac, depends on the context—religious, historical, or cultural.


### **1. Major Dialect Groups of Aramaic**
Aramaic is typically divided into the following main groups:

#### **Old Aramaic (circa 1200–700 BCE)**  
- Early dialects spoken by the Arameans and used in inscriptions.

#### **Imperial Aramaic (circa 700–300 BCE)**  
- A standardized form used across the vast Achaemenid Empire for administration.

#### **Middle Aramaic (circa 300 BCE–200 CE)**  
Includes regional and literary dialects:
- **Palestinian Aramaic**: Used in Judea and Galilee, the region where Galilean Aramaic developed.
- **Nabataean Aramaic**: Spoken in Petra and parts of Arabia.
- **Palmyrene Aramaic**: Associated with the city of Palmyra.

#### **Late Aramaic (circa 200 CE onward)**  
Often categorized into **Western** and **Eastern** Aramaic:
- **Western Aramaic**
  - Galilean Aramaic: Spoken in Galilee during the time of Jesus and widely used by Jews in the region.
  - Samaritan Aramaic: Used by the Samaritan community in liturgy.
  - Christian Palestinian Aramaic: A Christian dialect used in religious texts.
- **Eastern Aramaic**
  - Classical Syriac: A literary and liturgical language for Syriac Christianity.
  - Mandaic: The liturgical language of the Mandaeans.
  - Babylonian Jewish Aramaic: Found in the Babylonian Talmud.
  - Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Chaldean Neo-Aramaic: Modern dialects spoken by Assyrian Christians and Chaldeans.

#### **Modern Aramaic (Neo-Aramaic, from the Middle Ages onward)**  
- Still spoken in some communities in the Middle East, such as Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Mandaeans, with dialects like Turoyo, Sureth, and others.


### **2. Galilean Aramaic vs. Classical Syriac**

#### **Galilean Aramaic**
- **Historical Significance**: 
  - Spoken in Galilee during the Second Temple period (circa 500 BCE–70 CE) and the time of Jesus. It is the likely language of daily life for Jesus and his disciples.
  - Influenced the Aramaic used in Jewish texts like the Targumim (Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible) and portions of the Mishnah.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Considered a Western Aramaic dialect.
  - Differed from Judean Aramaic, which was spoken around Jerusalem.
- **Cultural Importance**: Important for understanding the socio-religious context of early Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism.

#### **Classical Syriac**
- **Historical Significance**: 
  - Developed in Edessa (modern-day Urfa, Turkey) and became the primary literary and liturgical language of Syriac Christianity from the 2nd century CE onward.
  - A prominent vehicle for theological discourse, translating Greek Christian works and preserving early Christian writings.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Belongs to Eastern Aramaic.
  - Extensively developed for written texts, including the Peshitta (the Syriac Bible).
- **Cultural Importance**: Influential in the spread of Christianity to the Middle East, Central Asia, and India.

### **3. Which Is More Important?**
The relative importance of Galilean Aramaic and Classical Syriac depends on the context:

- **Religious and Historical Context**:
  - **Galilean Aramaic** is critical for understanding the Jewish and early Christian milieu, including the life of Jesus and the development of Rabbinic traditions.
  - **Classical Syriac** holds immense importance in Christian history as the language of Syriac Christianity, theological scholarship, and the Peshitta.

- **Linguistic and Cultural Context**:
  - **Galilean Aramaic** is vital for historical linguistics and biblical studies, especially the study of the New Testament.
  - **Classical Syriac** has a richer literary and theological corpus, which has been preserved and continues to be used liturgically.


### **Conclusion**
Both dialects are crucial, but their importance depends on the focus area:
- **Galilean Aramaic**: Central to studies of early Christianity and Judaism.
- **Classical Syriac**: Essential for understanding the theological and literary traditions of Syriac Christianity.

Neither dialect overshadows the other; each has a unique role in its respective historical and cultural context.

- Is it so that Peshitta is in Syriac Aramaic? does this make Peshitta closer to Semitic thinking than Greek translations

A.
Yes, the *Peshitta* is written in **Classical Syriac**, a dialect of Eastern Aramaic. This linguistic and cultural context aligns the *Peshitta* closely with Semitic thinking, making it more reflective of the thought patterns and idioms of the ancient Near Eastern cultures from which the biblical texts originate. Here's why this is significant:



### **1. The Peshitta and Syriac Aramaic**
- **Classical Syriac** is an Aramaic dialect used primarily in Syriac Christianity. It developed in Edessa and became the liturgical and literary language of the Syriac Christian tradition.
- The *Peshitta* includes translations of the Hebrew Bible (*Tanakh*) and the New Testament into Syriac. 
  - For the Old Testament, the *Peshitta* is based on the Hebrew text (similar to the Masoretic Text) but often reflects influence from the Greek Septuagint.
  - For the New Testament, it contains most of the books recognized in the Christian canon, though there are variations depending on the tradition.

### **2. Semitic Thinking in the Peshitta**
- **Semitic Roots**: Syriac Aramaic, like Hebrew and other Semitic languages, shares fundamental linguistic features, such as:
  - **Root-based morphology**: Words are built from triconsonantal roots, common in Hebrew and Arabic.
  - **Idiomatic expressions**: Reflect a worldview similar to ancient Hebrew texts, emphasizing concrete and relational ideas.
  - **Syntax**: Word order and sentence structures reflect the patterns found in Hebrew and other Semitic languages.
  
- **Semitic Cultural Framework**:
  - The *Peshitta's* translators were native speakers of a Semitic language and deeply embedded in a Semitic cultural context, which helped preserve the underlying thought patterns and idioms of the Hebrew Bible and, to some extent, the Jewish background of the New Testament.

### **3. Comparison with Greek Translations**
- **Greek Translations (e.g., the Septuagint)**:
  - Greek is an Indo-European language with a different linguistic structure, including a more abstract vocabulary and a philosophical orientation.
  - When translating Semitic texts into Greek, there is often a shift in nuance. Greek tends to favor precision and abstraction, which sometimes obscures the concrete, relational, and idiomatic nature of Semitic expressions.
  - For example, Hebrew anthropomorphic or metaphorical descriptions of God often become more abstract in Greek.

- **Peshitta's Proximity to Semitic Thinking**:
  - The *Peshitta* retains many idiomatic expressions and structures that mirror the Hebrew Bible's style, preserving its original "flavor."
  - Its linguistic affinity with Hebrew and its cultural proximity to the Near Eastern milieu make the *Peshitta* more aligned with the worldview and expression of the biblical authors than Greek translations.


### **4. Theological and Linguistic Implications**
- The *Peshitta* provides a valuable resource for understanding the Bible in a linguistic framework closer to its original Semitic context.
- For Hebrew Bible studies, the *Peshitta* often serves as an important comparative witness, complementing the Greek Septuagint.
- For New Testament studies, the *Peshitta* helps illuminate how early Semitic-speaking Christians interpreted and transmitted the Greek New Testament texts into their cultural-linguistic framework.


### **Conclusion**
Yes, the *Peshitta*'s basis in Syriac Aramaic places it closer to Semitic thinking than Greek translations like the Septuagint. This linguistic and cultural alignment helps preserve the idiomatic and relational nuances of the biblical texts, offering a perspective more in tune with the worldview of the original authors.

Q. is it so that the old testament in the Peshitta, is based on Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek Septuagint? 

A.
The Old Testament in the *Peshitta* is primarily based on **Hebrew** texts, with some influence from **Aramaic** and the **Greek Septuagint**. Here's a detailed breakdown of its textual origins and influences:

### **1. Primary Basis: Hebrew Texts**
- The *Peshitta* Old Testament is fundamentally a **translation from the Hebrew Bible**, particularly texts similar to the **Masoretic Text** (MT), which later became the standard version of the Hebrew Scriptures in Rabbinic Judaism.
- This alignment with Hebrew is evident in the phrasing and structure of many passages in the *Peshitta* that closely mirror the Masoretic Text.

### **2. Influence of Aramaic**
- **Aramaic Linguistic Context**:
  - Since Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic, the translation naturally reflects Aramaic linguistic and cultural features, which sometimes align closely with Hebrew idioms and structures.
  - The *Peshitta* translators may have been influenced by the existing **Targumim**—Aramaic translations or paraphrases of the Hebrew Bible—particularly in their treatment of idiomatic expressions.

- **Shared Semitic Heritage**:
  - The similarities between Hebrew and Syriac Aramaic allowed the *Peshitta* translators to retain many of the original nuances of the Hebrew text while expressing them naturally in Syriac.


### **3. Influence of the Greek Septuagint**
- **Direct Influence**:
  - Some parts of the *Peshitta* Old Testament appear to be influenced by the **Greek Septuagint (LXX)**, especially in cases where the Hebrew text was ambiguous or difficult to interpret. Examples include:
    - Passages where the *Peshitta* aligns more closely with the Septuagint than the Masoretic Text.
    - Books like the Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal texts (e.g., Wisdom, Tobit, 1 Maccabees), which were included in some versions of the *Peshitta* and were likely based on the Greek Septuagint since they were not originally written in Hebrew.

- **Indirect Influence**:
  - Even in books primarily translated from Hebrew, the translators may have consulted the Septuagint as a secondary source for clarification or alternative readings.

### **4. The *Peshitta* as a Composite Work**
The *Peshitta* Old Testament was likely produced over time by different translators and communities, which accounts for its varied sources:
- **Hebrew Base**: Most of the core canonical books (e.g., Torah, Prophets) are solidly rooted in the Hebrew tradition.
- **Septuagint Influence**: Certain books or sections show alignment with Greek readings, particularly where the Hebrew text was challenging or where the Septuagint had a strong tradition.
- **Aramaic Context**: The translation reflects the natural use of Syriac/Aramaic, providing a linguistic bridge between Hebrew and Greek traditions.

### **5. Examples of Interplay**
- **Genesis and Exodus**: These books closely follow the Hebrew text, showing minimal Septuagint influence.
- **Psalms and Isaiah**: While primarily Hebrew-based, these books occasionally align with the Greek Septuagint in specific readings or interpretations.
- **Deuterocanonical Books**: These are generally believed to have been translated from the Septuagint, as they were not part of the traditional Hebrew canon.

### **Conclusion**
The Old Testament in the *Peshitta* is primarily based on **Hebrew texts**, with clear **Aramaic linguistic features** and occasional **influence from the Greek Septuagint**. Its translators drew upon these sources to produce a text that resonated with Syriac-speaking communities while maintaining fidelity to the Hebrew Scriptures. The *Peshitta* serves as an important witness to how the Hebrew Bible was interpreted in the Semitic-speaking Christian tradition, incorporating insights from both the Hebrew and Greek traditions.

Q. is it so that the old testament of the protestants is closer to Tanakh than, the  old testament in the Peshitta? if so, why it does not seem rational, right?

A.
Yes, the Old Testament of Protestant Bibles is generally **closer to the *Tanakh*** than the Old Testament in the *Peshitta*, and this stems from their respective textual traditions and historical contexts. However, this difference is not necessarily irrational; it reflects different theological and cultural priorities. Here's a detailed explanation:


### **1. Protestant Old Testament and the Tanakh**
- **Shared Canonical Books**: The Protestant Old Testament includes the same books as the *Tanakh* (though the arrangement and division of the books differ). For example:
  - The Protestant Bible splits some books (e.g., 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles), whereas the *Tanakh* treats them as single books.
  - The order of books is different: the *Tanakh* ends with Chronicles, whereas the Protestant Old Testament ends with the Prophets (e.g., Malachi).

- **Textual Tradition**:
  - Protestant translations of the Old Testament are generally based on the **Masoretic Text (MT)**, the authoritative Hebrew text of the *Tanakh*, standardized by Jewish scholars around the 10th century CE.
  - This makes the Protestant Old Testament textually and canonically closer to the Jewish *Tanakh* than the *Peshitta* Old Testament, which reflects a broader set of influences.

### **2. Old Testament in the Peshitta**
- The *Peshitta* Old Testament was translated into Syriac (Aramaic) primarily from Hebrew texts, but it also shows:
  - **Influence from the Septuagint (LXX)**, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, especially in areas where the Hebrew text was ambiguous.
  - Inclusion of **Deuterocanonical books** (e.g., Wisdom, Tobit, 1 Maccabees), which are absent from the *Tanakh* and Protestant Old Testament but are part of the Septuagint and Catholic/Orthodox canons.

- **Broader Canonical Tradition**:
  - The *Peshitta* reflects the textual and theological traditions of Syriac Christianity, which, like other early Christian traditions, accepted a broader canon of scripture influenced by the Septuagint.

### **3. Why Does This Seem "Irrational"?**
The apparent "irrationality" comes from the expectation that Christianity, which emerged from Judaism, would prioritize the *Tanakh*’s structure and content. However, historical and theological factors explain the divergence:

#### **A. Protestant Focus on the Hebrew Text (Tanakh)**
- The Protestant Reformation emphasized **sola scriptura** ("scripture alone") and sought to return to the original texts of the Bible.
- Reformers like Martin Luther prioritized the **Masoretic Text**, as it was seen as the authoritative text of the Hebrew Scriptures and closer to the Jewish roots of Christianity.
- Deuterocanonical books (from the Septuagint) were excluded because they were not part of the Hebrew canon recognized by Rabbinic Judaism.

#### **B. Peshitta's Broader Canonical and Textual Influences**
- Early Christianity, including Syriac Christianity, emerged in a context where the **Septuagint** was widely used, even by Jewish communities in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.
- The *Peshitta* reflects this early Christian tradition, incorporating elements from the Septuagint alongside Hebrew texts. The inclusion of the Deuterocanonical books shows how Syriac Christianity embraced a broader scriptural canon to address theological and pastoral needs.
- Syriac Christians were less concerned with adhering strictly to the Jewish canon and more focused on preserving texts that were spiritually and theologically meaningful in their context.

### **4. Rationality of the Differences**
The differences between the Protestant Old Testament, the *Tanakh*, and the *Peshitta* are rational when viewed within their historical and theological frameworks:

- **Protestant Old Testament**: Aimed to align with the Jewish *Tanakh* for its perceived textual and theological purity, reflecting the Reformation's emphasis on returning to the "original" sources.
- **Peshitta Old Testament**: Represents an early Christian engagement with both the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint, reflecting the diversity of textual traditions in the early centuries of Christianity.

Neither approach is "irrational"; they simply reflect different priorities:
- Protestants sought to reclaim the Hebrew canon as the authoritative source.
- Syriac Christians embraced a broader and more inclusive scriptural tradition, reflecting the early Christian church's practice of incorporating texts that resonated with their faith and mission.

### **Conclusion**
While the Protestant Old Testament is closer to the *Tanakh* than the *Peshitta* Old Testament, this divergence arises from differing historical contexts and theological priorities. Both traditions are rational within their respective frameworks, with the *Peshitta* emphasizing inclusivity and the Protestant Old Testament emphasizing a return to the Jewish roots of the text. Understanding these differences enriches our appreciation of the complex history of biblical transmission and canonization.

<!-- # **Studying the Peshitta and Understanding the Message of Jesus Christ** -->
<!-- 
1. **Preservation of Semitic Context**:
   - The Peshitta, written in Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic), offers a closer linguistic and cultural connection to the world in which Jesus lived. 
   - Jesus spoke Galilean Aramaic, which shares significant similarities with the Syriac dialect used in the Peshitta, particularly in vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Studying the Peshitta allows scholars to explore how the teachings of Jesus might have sounded in his native linguistic context.

2. **Clarity in Semitic Idioms**:
   - The Greek translations of the New Testament sometimes obscure or reframe Semitic idioms to fit Hellenistic thought patterns. The Peshitta retains many of these idiomatic expressions in their original Aramaic form, preserving nuances of meaning that align more closely with Jesus's cultural and linguistic background.
   - For instance, terms like **“Son of Man” (Bar Enasha)** take on richer meaning in Aramaic than in Greek, as the phrase reflects both humility and a divine connection in the Semitic tradition.

3. **Understanding Theology and Terminology**:
   - Key theological terms in the Peshitta, such as **"Alaha"** for God, resonate with the language Jesus himself would have used. This enhances comprehension of his message as delivered to an Aramaic-speaking audience.
   - The Peshitta also aids in understanding the connections between the Old Testament (in its Aramaic portions) and the teachings of Jesus, maintaining consistency in terminology and style.

---

### **Aramaic Dialects: Galilean, Classical Syriac, and the Peshitta**
1. **Galilean Aramaic (Spoken by Jesus)**:
   - This was a regional dialect of Western Aramaic spoken in first-century Galilee.
   - While not identical, Galilean Aramaic and Syriac (used in the Peshitta) are closely related, both being part of the broader Aramaic family. Studying the Peshitta provides a glimpse into the broader linguistic context of Jesus’s teachings, even if it doesn't fully represent the Galilean dialect.

2. **Classical Syriac**:
   - Syriac is an Eastern Aramaic dialect, used extensively in Christian liturgical texts and writings, including the Peshitta.
   - Though Eastern Aramaic, it retains many features of the Semitic linguistic structure and idioms found in Galilean Aramaic.

3. **The Peshitta’s Dialect**:
   - The Peshitta represents a formalized version of Classical Syriac, used in the liturgical and theological traditions of the early Syriac-speaking Church. Its linguistic structure remains rooted in Semitic ways of thinking and provides valuable insights into first-century Semitic culture.

---

### **The Peshitta and Semitic Thinking vs. Greek Translation**
1. **Semitic Thought Patterns**:
   - The Peshitta remains closer to Semitic linguistic structures, including its syntax, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions.
   - Greek translations often adapt Semitic phrases to fit Hellenistic philosophical frameworks. For example:
     - Greek emphasizes abstract reasoning, whereas Semitic languages like Aramaic are concrete and relational in expression.
     - In the Peshitta, metaphors and expressions are preserved in their original cultural and linguistic form, allowing for a more authentic interpretation of Jesus’s teachings.

2. **Examples of Difference**:
   - **Matthew 5:3 (Beatitudes)**: The Greek uses "Blessed are the poor in spirit," whereas the Peshitta retains a more Semitic nuance, emphasizing humility and reliance on God.
   - **John 1:1**: The Greek emphasizes Logos (word as a philosophical concept), while the Peshitta uses **Miltha**, a term rooted in the Aramaic tradition that carries both verbal and creative connotations, closer to Semitic theology.

---

### **Peshitta vs. Tanakh**
1. **Textual Nature**:
   - The **Peshitta** is primarily a Syriac version of the Christian Bible, including both the Old Testament and New Testament.
     - The Old Testament in the Peshitta is largely a translation of the Hebrew Tanakh but reflects interpretations consistent with early Christian theology.
   - The **Tanakh** is the canonical Hebrew Bible of Judaism, consisting of the Torah (Law), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings).

2. **Linguistic and Theological Perspectives**:
   - The Peshitta Old Testament mirrors the Hebrew text of the Tanakh but incorporates Aramaic as its linguistic medium, which was more accessible to early Jewish and Christian communities in the Near East.
   - Theological differences arise in how the Peshitta interprets messianic prophecies. For example:
     - Isaiah 7:14 ("A virgin shall conceive") is rendered in the Peshitta with an interpretation more aligned with Christian theology, while Jewish interpretations in the Tanakh emphasize the original Hebrew term **“almah”** (young woman).

3. **Liturgical Use**:
   - The Peshitta serves as the primary scriptural text for Syriac Christian communities, while the Tanakh is central to Jewish worship and theology.

---

### **Reflection**
Studying the Peshitta bridges the linguistic and cultural gap between Jesus’s teachings and their Greek transmission. It provides a valuable lens through which to view the Semitic mindset and idioms of his time, offering deeper insight into the authenticity of his message. The comparison between the Peshitta and Tanakh further emphasizes the shared roots of Jewish and Christian scriptures, while also highlighting how linguistic and theological differences shape the interpretation and reception of biblical texts. -->

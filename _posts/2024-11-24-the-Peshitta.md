# **Studying the Peshitta and Understanding the Message of Jesus Christ**

1. **Preservation of Semitic Context**:
   - The Peshitta, written in Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic), offers a closer linguistic and cultural connection to the world in which Jesus lived. 
   - Jesus spoke Galilean Aramaic, which shares significant similarities with the Syriac dialect used in the Peshitta, particularly in vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Studying the Peshitta allows scholars to explore how the teachings of Jesus might have sounded in his native linguistic context.

2. **Clarity in Semitic Idioms**:
   - The Greek translations of the New Testament sometimes obscure or reframe Semitic idioms to fit Hellenistic thought patterns. The Peshitta retains many of these idiomatic expressions in their original Aramaic form, preserving nuances of meaning that align more closely with Jesus's cultural and linguistic background.
   - For instance, terms like **“Son of Man” (Bar Enasha)** take on richer meaning in Aramaic than in Greek, as the phrase reflects both humility and a divine connection in the Semitic tradition.

3. **Understanding Theology and Terminology**:
   - Key theological terms in the Peshitta, such as **"Alaha"** for God, resonate with the language Jesus himself would have used. This enhances comprehension of his message as delivered to an Aramaic-speaking audience.
   - The Peshitta also aids in understanding the connections between the Old Testament (in its Aramaic portions) and the teachings of Jesus, maintaining consistency in terminology and style.

### **Aramaic Dialects: Galilean, Classical Syriac, and the Peshitta**
1. **Galilean Aramaic (Spoken by Jesus)**:
   - This was a regional dialect of Western Aramaic spoken in first-century Galilee.
   - While not identical, Galilean Aramaic and Syriac (used in the Peshitta) are closely related, both being part of the broader Aramaic family. Studying the Peshitta provides a glimpse into the broader linguistic context of Jesus’s teachings, even if it doesn't fully represent the Galilean dialect.

2. **Classical Syriac**:
   - Syriac is an Eastern Aramaic dialect, used extensively in Christian liturgical texts and writings, including the Peshitta.
   - Though Eastern Aramaic, it retains many features of the Semitic linguistic structure and idioms found in Galilean Aramaic.

3. **The Peshitta’s Dialect**:
   - The Peshitta represents a formalized version of Classical Syriac, used in the liturgical and theological traditions of the early Syriac-speaking Church. Its linguistic structure remains rooted in Semitic ways of thinking and provides valuable insights into first-century Semitic culture.

### **The Peshitta and Semitic Thinking vs. Greek Translation**
1. **Semitic Thought Patterns**:
   - The Peshitta remains closer to Semitic linguistic structures, including its syntax, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions.
   - Greek translations often adapt Semitic phrases to fit Hellenistic philosophical frameworks. For example:
     - Greek emphasizes abstract reasoning, whereas Semitic languages like Aramaic are concrete and relational in expression.
     - In the Peshitta, metaphors and expressions are preserved in their original cultural and linguistic form, allowing for a more authentic interpretation of Jesus’s teachings.

2. **Examples of Difference**:
   - **Matthew 5:3 (Beatitudes)**: The Greek uses "Blessed are the poor in spirit," whereas the Peshitta retains a more Semitic nuance, emphasizing humility and reliance on God.
   - **John 1:1**: The Greek emphasizes Logos (word as a philosophical concept), while the Peshitta uses **Miltha**, a term rooted in the Aramaic tradition that carries both verbal and creative connotations, closer to Semitic theology.

### **Peshitta vs. Tanakh**
1. **Textual Nature**:
   - The **Peshitta** is primarily a Syriac version of the Christian Bible, including both the Old Testament and New Testament.
     - The Old Testament in the Peshitta is largely a translation of the Hebrew Tanakh but reflects interpretations consistent with early Christian theology.
   - The **Tanakh** is the canonical Hebrew Bible of Judaism, consisting of the Torah (Law), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings).

2. **Linguistic and Theological Perspectives**:
   - The Peshitta Old Testament mirrors the Hebrew text of the Tanakh but incorporates Aramaic as its linguistic medium, which was more accessible to early Jewish and Christian communities in the Near East.
   - Theological differences arise in how the Peshitta interprets messianic prophecies. For example:
     - Isaiah 7:14 ("A virgin shall conceive") is rendered in the Peshitta with an interpretation more aligned with Christian theology, while Jewish interpretations in the Tanakh emphasize the original Hebrew term **“almah”** (young woman).

3. **Liturgical Use**:
   - The Peshitta serves as the primary scriptural text for Syriac Christian communities, while the Tanakh is central to Jewish worship and theology.

### **Reflection**
Studying the Peshitta bridges the linguistic and cultural gap between Jesus’s teachings and their Greek transmission. It provides a valuable lens through which to view the Semitic mindset and idioms of his time, offering deeper insight into the authenticity of his message. The comparison between the Peshitta and Tanakh further emphasizes the shared roots of Jewish and Christian scriptures, while also highlighting how linguistic and theological differences shape the interpretation and reception of biblical texts.

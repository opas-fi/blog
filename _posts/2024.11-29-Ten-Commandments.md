# The Ten Commandments and Their Islamic Counterparts

The **Ten Commandments**, central to Judaism and Christianity, outline ethical principles and obligations. In Islam, these principles are echoed in the **Qur'an** and **Hadith**, which emphasize similar moral and spiritual values. Below is a comparison of the Ten Commandments with corresponding Islamic views:

### **The Ten Commandments and Their Islamic Counterparts**

| **Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17)**            | **Islamic View and Corresponding Teachings** |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **1. I am the Lord your God; you shall have no other gods before me.** | **Tawhid** (monotheism) is the foundation of Islam. The Qur'an repeatedly asserts the worship of Allah alone: "There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence" (Qur'an 2:255). |
| **2. You shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath.** | Islam strictly forbids idolatry and associating partners with Allah (**shirk**), emphasizing that God cannot be represented by images: "Do not set up rivals to Allah" (Qur'an 2:22). |
| **3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.** | Respect for Allah's name is paramount in Islam. Muslims are encouraged to speak of Allah with reverence and to avoid trivializing His name: "Do not take Allah's name in your oaths if you intend deception" (Qur'an 2:224). |
| **4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.** | While Islam does not have a Sabbath, Friday (**Jumu'ah**) is designated for communal prayer and spiritual reflection: "O you who have believed, when [the call to] prayer is made for Friday, hurry to the remembrance of Allah and leave off trade" (Qur'an 62:9). |
| **5. Honor your father and your mother.** | Respect for parents is a core Islamic teaching: "We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness" (Qur'an 31:14). |
| **6. You shall not murder.** | The sanctity of life is emphasized: "Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain mankind entirely" (Qur'an 5:32). |
| **7. You shall not commit adultery.** | Adultery (**zina**) is a major sin in Islam: "Do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is an immorality and an evil way" (Qur'an 17:32). |
| **8. You shall not steal.** | Theft is prohibited, with strict rules against taking what does not belong to you: "As for the thief... cut off their hands as recompense for what they committed" (Qur'an 5:38). This is balanced with compassion in cases of genuine need. |
| **9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.** | Truthfulness is a key virtue: "Do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it—his heart is indeed sinful" (Qur'an 2:283). |
| **10. You shall not covet... anything that belongs to your neighbor.** | Envy and greed are discouraged: "And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others" (Qur'an 4:32). Contentment and gratitude are emphasized. |

### **Key Observations**
1. **Core Beliefs**:
   - The first few commandments (monotheism, idolatry, reverence for God) align closely with Islam’s central tenets of **Tawhid** (oneness of God) and avoidance of **shirk** (associating partners with God).

2. **Moral Conduct**:
   - Prohibitions against murder, theft, adultery, and falsehood resonate strongly in Islamic ethics. Islam extends these commandments with detailed laws governing interpersonal conduct.

3. **Respect for Parents**:
   - Both traditions emphasize filial piety. Islam’s explicit commandments regarding parents, found in multiple verses, closely mirror this commandment.

4. **Sabbath vs. Jumu’ah**:
   - While Judaism and Christianity observe a Sabbath day of rest, Islam designates Friday as a day for communal worship but does not prohibit work.

5. **Material Desires**:
   - The commandment against covetousness reflects Islamic teachings on controlling envy and greed, which are seen as spiritual diseases.

### **Conclusion**
The Ten Commandments reflect universal moral principles shared across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Islam, these principles are not confined to a specific set of ten but are integrated throughout the Qur'an and Sunnah, offering comprehensive guidance for spiritual and ethical living.

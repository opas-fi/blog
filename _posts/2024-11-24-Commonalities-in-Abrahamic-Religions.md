<!-- # Exploring Commonalities in Abrahamic Religions -->

The Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—are often perceived as distinct entities. Yet a closer look reveals a shared foundation rooted in their approach to faith, language, and ritual. This article delves into these commonalities, reflecting parallel values, and shares linguistic expressions of faith.

### The First Commandment and the First Pillar of Islam: Centralizing Belief in One God

At the core of all Abrahamic faiths lies an unshakable monotheism. When Jesus was asked to name the greatest commandment, he replied by quoting the Shema, an ancient Jewish prayer central to the Torah:  
> "The first of all commandments is this: Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord; and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your might; this is the first commandment." (Mark 12:29–30)

This aligns closely with the **First Pillar of Islam**, known as the **Shahada**, which is a declaration of faith:  
> "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger."

Both statements emphasize a singular devotion to one God. While the Shahada also acknowledges Muhammad as a prophet, the essence of the statement—the proclamation of God’s oneness—parallels the monotheistic declaration in the Shema.

### Abraham’s Legacy of Faith and Submission

Abraham, a patriarch across all three religions, is revered for his unwavering faith and submission to God. His belief in one God is celebrated in Genesis, where his faith is described as righteousness:  
> "Abraham believed in God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."

This story is foundational across the Torah, Bible, and Quran, where Abraham's radical monotheistic faith acts as a blueprint for believers. His submission to God’s will set a model for future prophets—Moses in Judaism, Jesus in Christianity, and Muhammad in Islam—all of whom demonstrated lives of devotion and surrender to God. Abraham's legacy remains a symbol of faith, showing how true belief unifies the essence of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

### The Five Pillars of Islam: Values Shared by All Faiths

If we consider the **Five Pillars of Islam**—the foundational practices for Muslims—without specific reference to Muhammad as a prophet, the principles align remarkably well with values also upheld in Judaism and Christianity:

1. **Belief in One God**  
2. **Daily Prayer**  
3. **Charity to the Poor and Needy**  
4. **Fasting and Purification of Body and Soul**  
5. **Pilgrimage to Holy Sites**

These practices promote faith, compassion, self-discipline, and spiritual growth. Each of these pillars, at their core, aligns with tenets in Judaism and Christianity. A Jew or Christian dedicated to loving God, aiding others, and seeking personal and communal growth could embody these principles, demonstrating the shared ethical values across all three religions. These pillars represent a common spiritual journey toward faith and goodness that transcends denominational boundaries.

### Salat and Daily Prayer: The Tradition of Structured Devotion

Daily prayer is a profound ritual in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Muslims observe **Salat**, praying five times each day, rooted in spiritual discipline and connection with God. This practice reflects the **canonical hours** observed in early Christianity, a structured devotion dividing the day into times of prayer, including three or four night vigils. These Christian practices, still maintained in some monastic communities, drew inspiration from Jewish customs of praying at set intervals, as referenced in Psalm 119:164:  
> “Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.”

These shared customs of prayer structure reflect a commitment to mindfulness and devotion, practiced with consistency throughout the day. These parallels highlight desire for continuous spiritual reflection.

### Jesus: A Figure Rooted in Judaism

In the Gospel of Mark, we see Jesus affirming his commitment to Jewish teachings, emphasizing that he came not to abolish but to fulfill the law:  
> "Do not suppose that I have come to weaken the law [Torah] or the prophets; I have not come to weaken, but to fulfill." (Matthew 5:17)

Jesus’s life and ministry are deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, illustrating the strong connections between Judaism and Christianity. This recognition underscores a shared heritage—Jesus teaches from the Torah, emphasizing the continuity between Judaism and Christianity. Far from creating a new tradition, Jesus’s message reinforced Jewish teachings, inspiring a sense of unity between the two religions.

### Linguistic Similarities: Witnessing to One God

One of the most striking linguistic connections lies in the term **Shahada** in Arabic, meaning “to proclaim, to witness, or to testify.” This resonates with the **Shema** in Aramaic, meaning “to hear” or “to witness.” Both terms capture a declaration of faith in one God:  
- **Shema (Aramaic):** "The Lord our God [Alaha] is one."  
- **Shahada (Arabic):** "There is no god but Allah."

This linguistic parallel highlights the unity in the most fundamental declaration of faith across the Abrahamic religions. As Jesus articulated in Mark, “The first of all the commandments” was the acknowledgment of one God. The use of nearly identical terms reinforces the shared spiritual language and devotion.

### Peace, Submission, and Surrender: The Language of Faith

The word **shalom** in Hebrew, **shalem** in Aramaic, and **salaam** in Arabic each mean “peace,” but they encompass much more. In each language, these words imply submission, wholeness, and surrender. In Aramaic, **shalem** also conveys submission and surrender to God’s will. This understanding deepens in the Arabic term **Muslim**, which translates to “one who is surrendered” to God.

Now, there are other words that reflect shared meanings between Aramaic and Arabic. One example is `Shalem` used in  the Peshitta. 
- Hebrew: `Shalom`. Arabic: `Salaam`. Aramaic: `Shalem`.
- Shalem: submit to God. also means: be at peace. Shalem: be surren-
dered. 
- Mu shalem (Mu-shalem.)= one who is surrendered.
- In Arabic Muslim= one who is surrendered.

The shared linguistic roots of these terms illustrate the convergence of peace, submission, and unity in each faith. This connection emphasizes the Abrahamic call for believers to submit to God’s will and seek peace within themselves and with others, bringing harmony to both language and practice.

### Conclusion: 

Examining the Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—reveals profound commonalities in their beliefs, languages, and practices. From the First Commandment and the Shahada to the legacy of Abraham and structured daily prayers, these faiths share a core commitment to one God, ethical behavior, and spiritual discipline. The linguistic parallels further illustrate this unity, with words like **Shema**, **Shahada**, **Shalom**, and **Salaam** expressing shared ideas of faith, peace, and surrender.

<!-- These commonalities offer a reminder that despite different paths, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam converge on similar principles, encouraging a deeper understanding and respect among their followers.  -->

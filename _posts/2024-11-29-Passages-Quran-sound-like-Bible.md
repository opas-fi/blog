#  Passages from Quran scripture that sound like from Bible


### Story 

“Do you mind,” he began, “if I open with some passages from scripture?”

Assuming he was referring to the Bible, they said, “Please do!”

“Jesus is the Messiah,”  “sinless, supernaturally conceived through a virgin named Mary by the spirit of God, was taken up to be close to God and will be the judge of the world. . . . He is the Word of God, He is the Word of Truth. . . . He heals the sick and the blind, He can even raise the dead.”


Everyone in the audience was listening in rapt attention, nodding their heads, some calling out “Hallelujah!” and “Praise the Lord!” 

Then he stopped and looked up at them.
“Every word I just spoke came from the Qur’an.”

### Analysis

This story highlights the profound, yet often surprising, commonalities between the **Qur'an** and the **Bible** regarding descriptions of Jesus, underscoring the shared roots of Islam and Christianity. The speaker's choice to quote these passages from the Qur'an, while leaving the audience initially under the impression that he was reading from the Bible, serves as a powerful reminder of the theological intersections between these two religions.

### Similarities in Descriptions of Jesus
In the Qur'an, Jesus (known as **Isa** in Arabic) is indeed depicted as the **Messiah**, born of the **Virgin Mary (Maryam)**, and **sinless**—echoing key aspects of the Christian portrayal of Jesus. Specific Qur'anic verses affirm his miraculous birth (Qur'an 3:45-47), his role as a **prophet** (Qur'an 5:110), and his unique closeness to God. The Qur'an also emphasizes that Jesus performed miracles such as healing the sick and giving sight to the blind (Qur'an 3:49). These descriptions resonate deeply with Christian beliefs about Jesus, creating an unexpected overlap that many Christians might not realize exists within Islamic scripture.

### Audience Reactions: Expectations vs. Reality
The audience's enthusiastic responses—"Hallelujah" and "Praise the Lord"—show that the message resonated with their faith, drawing them in with familiar affirmations of Jesus's special role. The revelation that these words originated from the Qur'an can be both enlightening and challenging, encouraging a reevaluation of preconceived notions about Islam. This moment highlights how religious texts, often seen as separate and conflicting, contain shared beliefs that are core to both faiths.

### Bridging Religious Gaps
The speaker’s approach is especially meaningful in an age where misunderstandings and misconceptions fuel tensions between religions. By emphasizing common ground in a way that breaks down assumptions, he demonstrates that Islam and Christianity, though distinct, share reverence for Jesus and many values. 

Much like the story of Pope Urban II's rallying call to Crusade participants, where misunderstandings and manipulations of religious narratives led to centuries of conflict, this approach of finding common scriptural ground fosters understanding rather than division. It is a reminder that, despite centuries of separation, shared truths exist in both traditions, encouraging both Muslims and Christians to see one another through a lens of common faith rather than fear or suspicion. 

In the context of this story, passages like those in the Qur'an not only bridge historical divides but also offer an invitation to explore the interconnected spiritual heritage of Abrahamic religions.

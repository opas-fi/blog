### The Term “God”

The term “God” encompasses a broad and complex history shaped by linguistic, cultural, and religious contexts. Here's a deeper reflection:

### 1. **Cultural and Linguistic Roots**
   - The English word **“God”** carries significant cultural baggage, often tied to the monotheistic traditions of Abrahamic religions. However, its linguistic origin diverges from the Semitic roots of Abrahamic religions. 
   - **Proto-Germanic “gott”** reflects a much earlier, pagan understanding of divine beings, unrelated to the Abrahamic monotheistic deity.
   - The classical languages—Greek and Latin—introduce terms like **“Zeus”** and **“Deus,”** highlighting a polytheistic or philosophical understanding of divinity, further shaping how later European cultures conceptualized "God."

### 2. **Semitic Names of God**
   - **“Allah,” “Alaha,” and “Elohim”** stand apart as they are deeply rooted in the Semitic languages and carry profound theological significance.
   - These terms specifically denote a singular, omnipotent creator, aligning closely with the monotheistic vision central to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.
   - **Aramaic “Alaha,”** used frequently in the Peshitta, underscores continuity between early Jewish-Christian traditions and Islamic theology. It connects Jesus’s own reference to God with the Islamic term **“Allah.”**
   - Similarly, **“Elohim”** in Hebrew, though *grammatically plural*, signifies the singular Almighty in Jewish texts, further reinforcing the unique oneness of God in Abrahamic faiths.

### 3. **Theological Clarity**
   - For Muslims, the use of **“Allah”** explicitly identifies the singular deity of Islam, avoiding the cultural and linguistic ambiguities of the English term “God.”
   - Christians in various traditions, especially in Eastern and Semitic contexts, also used **“Alaha”** and related terms, which further confirms their shared understanding of a singular, transcendent Creator.

### 4. **Misconceptions in Translation**
   - The word **“God”** in English or **“Deus”** in Latin doesn’t fully convey the specificity and theological nuance of **“Allah,”** **“Alaha,”** or **“Elohim.”** 
   - These Semitic names carry not only linguistic specificity but also embody the core monotheistic idea of an all-encompassing, personal, and omnipotent deity unique to the Abrahamic traditions.

### 5. **Commonalities Across Abrahamic Faiths**
   - A key unifying thread in Abrahamic religions is their worship of the Almighty Creator. Whether referred to as **“Allah,” “Alaha,”** or **“Elohim,”** the essence of the divine remains consistent—a singular, all-powerful deity.
   - Jesus’s reference to **“Alaha”** provides an important bridge between Christianity and Islam, demonstrating shared spiritual roots.



In conclusion, while the term **“God”** is widely recognized, its historical and cultural connotations can obscure the specific theological identity of the Almighty in Abrahamic faiths. The names **“Allah,” “Alaha,”** and **“Elohim”** preserve this identity, reflecting the deep linguistic, cultural, and spiritual legacy of these traditions.

# The Name of God in the Abrahamic Faiths


The words used for God in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam might seem distinct, but they’re all connected by shared roots in ancient Semitic languages—languages that have shaped these religious traditions for thousands of years. 

We’re going to explore three primary languages here: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. Each holds a unique place in the history of these faiths but shares something profound when it comes to describing the divine.

### Semitic Language Roots and God’s Name

Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic are all part of the Semitic language family. Hebrew is the oldest, central to Judaism and its sacred texts. Then we have Aramaic, which, for centuries, was widely spoken across the Near East and influenced early Judaism and Christianity. Finally, Arabic—the most recent of the three—is the language of the Quran in Islam.

These languages share common linguistic roots Let’s look at each language and how it names God.

### The Name of God in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic

- In **Aramaic**, the word for God is **“Alaha”**—that’s ܐܠܗܐ in the Syriac script. And in addition to Alaha, other Aramaic terms, like **Elah** and **Elaha**, also refer to God. In fact, the word “Alaha” is what Jesus himself would have used, reflecting the very essence of divinity.

- Moving to **Hebrew**, we have the word **“Elohim.”** Just like in Aramaic, this term emphasizes strength and supremacy. You can see it in names like Israel, which means “God strives,”. Elohim have been central to Jewish texts for thousands of years and speak to the very character of God in the Jewish faith.

- Then in **Arabic**, we have **“Allah.”** This term, closely related to the Aramaic Alaha and Hebrew Elohim, is central to Islam. The name Allah emphasizes God’s oneness and absolute power, a core concept in Islamic theology. 

When we look at these terms together—Alaha, Elohim, and Allah—we see a deep, shared history. It’s amazing how, across languages and faiths, these names connect so strongly.

For over five hundred years before the birth of Muhammad, Arab Christians and even some Jews in the Arabian peninsula used the word Allah for God. Roughly twenty million Arab Christians do so today. In fact, when Jesus spoke about God in everyday conversation, he would have used the same Aramaic word that every other Aramaic-speaker used: Alaha.

### Shared Terminology in Aramaic and Arabic

Now, there are other words that reflect shared meanings between Aramaic and Arabic. One example is `Shalem` used in  the Peshitta. 
- Hebrew: `Shalom`. Arabic: `Salaam`. Aramaic: `Shalem`.
- Shalem: submit to God. also means: be at peace. Shalem: be surren-
dered. 
- Mu shalem (Mu-shalem.)= one who is surrendered.
- In Arabic Muslim= one who is surrendered.

Islam and Christianity were not simply overlapping ideas. They were not merely compatible. In the most central sense, they were one continuum. 
Islam is the total submission to God which is the core message of Jesus Christ and his followers.
The Qur’an says, "`The religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His will`).” 3:19

Christianity was not intended by its founder as a new religion,
with strict rules, regulations, structures, and hierarchies, but as a continuity with and recovery of the essence of the old one. And
the exact same thing is true of Islam.

They were intended as movements, peaceful revolutions of the human heart. And they had an identical mission and agenda, right down to the very words: Repent and be converted. Submit to God. Be at peace. Be one—“mu”—who is surrendered—“shalem.” Mu-shalem. Muslim.

No wonder the Qur’an declared that Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were all Muslims. So, in the sense of the fundamental meaning of the word, are all **practicing** Christians and Jews.

### 1. **The Peshitta and Genesis 1:1**
   - The use of **"Alaha"** in the Peshitta’s Genesis 1:1 highlights an important continuity between the Semitic languages and the theological traditions they shaped. 
   - **"In the beginning Alaha created the heavens and the earth"** (Genesis-1.1 https://aramaica.org/peshitta/tanakh/genesis/genesis-1/) demonstrates that early Aramaic-speaking communities referred to the Creator with the term **"Alaha,"** which is closely related to **"Allah"** in Arabic.
   - This linguistic connection reflects a shared heritage between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, emphasizing that all three traditions trace their understanding of God to a common Semitic conception of the divine.'




### 2. **Use of Alaha in Ezra and Other Biblical Texts**
   - The claim that **“Alaha”** appears over 150 times in the Aramaic portions of biblical texts like Ezra reinforces the significance of this name in the historical and scriptural context.
   - Ezra, as part of the Hebrew Bible, includes Aramaic sections where **Alaha** is consistently used to refer to God. This strengthens the argument that **"Alaha"** was a common term for the singular deity worshipped by the people of that time.
   - It underscores that **"Alaha"** wasn’t a later Christian or Islamic innovation but rather part of the linguistic and religious fabric of the ancient Near East.



### 3. **Muslims Refer to Allah, Who Jesus Referred to as Alaha**
   - When Muslims say **“my God,”** they mean **“Allah,”** the Creator of the universe and the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.
   - **Jesus Christ’s use of “Alaha”** aligns closely with the Islamic term **“Allah,”** illustrating theological and linguistic continuity. 
   - This connection reinforces the shared monotheistic foundation of Islam and Christianity: Jesus, as recorded in the Peshitta, referred to God as **“Alaha,”** the same term used in Arabic-speaking Christian traditions and analogous to **“Allah”** in Islam.


### **Reflection and Integration**
The use of **“Alaha”** in ancient scriptures like the Peshitta and Ezra reveals a profound linguistic and theological unity across Abrahamic faiths. It demonstrates that:

1. The concept of **“God”** in these traditions is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a shared Semitic worldview.
2. The name **“Alaha”** predates both Islam and modern Christianity, showing continuity in how Semitic peoples addressed the divine.
3. For Muslims, calling God **“Allah”** is not merely a linguistic choice but a reflection of this historical connection to the same deity Jesus and earlier prophets worshipped.

This shared linguistic heritage dismantles misconceptions of division and highlights the unity of the Abrahamic understanding of God as the singular, transcendent Creator. Whether referred to as **Alaha**, **Allah**, or **Elohim**, the essence remains the same.

The historical use of **"Allah"** by Arab Christians and Jews, as well as the linguistic and theological connection to **"Alaha,"** offers a compelling reflection on the shared heritage of Abrahamic faiths. Let’s break it down:


### **1. Pre-Islamic Use of "Allah" Among Arab Christians and Jews**
- The fact that **Arab Christians and Jews used "Allah"** to refer to God centuries before the rise of Islam demonstrates that this term is not uniquely Islamic but rather a long-standing part of the Semitic linguistic tradition.
- **"Allah"** was used in the Arabian Peninsula by diverse religious groups to denote the singular, supreme deity. This aligns with the understanding of monotheism as it existed in both Jewish and Christian contexts in the region.

---

### **2. Continuity in Modern Arab Christianity**
- Today, around **twenty million Arab Christians** continue to use **"Allah"** in their prayers, scriptures, and daily worship. 
- This practice highlights the shared linguistic tradition and counters the misconception that "Allah" is exclusive to Islam. It reaffirms that for Arab Christians, **"Allah"** simply means "God," the Creator of the universe.



### **3. Jesus’s Use of "Alaha" in Aramaic**
- When Jesus referred to God in his native Aramaic, he used the term **"Alaha,"** which is the linguistic equivalent of **"Allah."** 
  - This shows that Jesus’s understanding and address of God is directly tied to the Semitic tradition shared with Arabic-speaking communities.
  - The term **"Alaha"** carries the same theological weight as **"Allah"** in Arabic and underscores the singular, supreme Creator central to Abrahamic faiths.


### **4. Linguistic and Theological Implications**
- The historical and ongoing use of **"Allah"** by Arab Christians and its linguistic equivalent **"Alaha"** by Jesus himself highlight that these terms are not about separate gods but about the same monotheistic understanding of the Creator.
- The continuity in these names reflects the deep interconnection between the Abrahamic faiths, rooted in a shared Semitic culture and language.


### **5. A Reflection on Shared Faith**
- The usage of **"Allah"** across diverse Abrahamic traditions is a testament to their shared origins. 
- Recognizing that Jesus himself used **"Alaha,"** which is analogous to **"Allah,"** bridges a gap of understanding. It acknowledges that Christians, Jews, and Muslims are speaking about the same Almighty Creator, even if their interpretations and traditions differ.


In conclusion, the historical and modern use of **"Allah"** and **"Alaha"** illustrates the deep interconnection between Abrahamic faiths. It challenges the notion of exclusivity and emphasizes a shared reverence for the singular, all-powerful God who transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries.

### Conclusion: A Shared Legacy of God’s Name

In conclusion, these names—Alaha, Elohim, and Allah—go beyond mere words. They carry history, culture, and a shared understanding of God’s singular nature across the Abrahamic faiths. The linguistic connections between Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic reveal just how intertwined these traditions are, reflecting common beliefs even through different expressions.

Understanding this shared heritage brings a richer perspective.

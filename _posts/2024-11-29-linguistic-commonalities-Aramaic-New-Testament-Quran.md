#  The *linguistic and textual commonalities* among the *Aramaic New Testament*, the *Arabic Qur’an*, and the *Hebrew Tanach* (Old Testament).

### Speech

I’ve been compiling a list of similarities between the Aramaic New Testament and the Arabic Qur’an, along with some overlay of the Hebrew Tanach, looking for overlaps, correspondences, and convergences.

“We know there are over three hundred words with Aramaic roots used in the original text of the Qur’an. There’s been a good deal written about these and about the sprinkling of Aramaic words found in the Greek New Testament, as you know. But those writings are quite limited in their scope. What we’re looking for here is textual synergies that can have a practical impact in the world of our culture and society at large, not only in academic circles, and even help in our efforts to mitigate the gaping chasm of fear and misunderstanding between the cultures of the Muslim East and Judeo-Christian West.

## Analysis

The speech highlights an intriguing and rarely discussed area of study: the **linguistic and textual commonalities** among the *Aramaic New Testament*, the *Arabic Qur’an*, and the *Hebrew Tanach* (Old Testament).

These texts, foundational to Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, respectively, have **shared linguistic roots and overlapping themes** that extend beyond academic interest into broader social and cultural significance.

### Linguistic Connections
1. **Shared Semitic Roots**: 
   - Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic are all **Semitic languages**, which means they share a common ancestry and linguistic structure. This makes their vocabularies, grammatical patterns, and linguistic rhythms highly compatible.
   - The Qur’an contains over **300 Aramaic-derived words**, and the Greek New Testament also incorporates numerous Aramaic terms, like "Abba" (father) and "Maranatha" (come, Lord). These linguistic ties underline the shared roots of the language Jesus spoke (Aramaic) and the language of the Qur’an (Arabic), reinforcing a historical continuity within Abrahamic traditions.

2. **Common Religious Terminology**:
   - Terms such as "Alaha" in Aramaic and "Allah" in Arabic both mean "God" and stem from the same ancient Semitic root, **“Il”**, used across all three languages. The Tanach also uses forms like **“El”** or **“Elohim”**, connecting back to the same linguistic root for God.
   - The Qur’an and New Testament share other key words rooted in Aramaic, such as **“salaam”** (peace) in Arabic, **“shalom”** in Hebrew, and **“shalem”** in Aramaic. These terms express a concept that spans all three faiths, emphasizing peace, surrender, and fulfillment.

### Textual and Thematic Synergies
1. **Unity of God**: 
   - The Qur’an, Aramaic New Testament, and Hebrew Tanach all emphasize **monotheism** as a core tenet. In all three, God is depicted as one, almighty, compassionate, and the ultimate judge of humanity. This is clearly seen in the **Shema** from the Tanach ("Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one"), mirrored in the **Shahada** from the Qur’an ("There is no god but Allah"), and echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who repeatedly affirmed the oneness of God in the New Testament.
   - This shared commitment to monotheism establishes a theological unity and could act as a bridge, inviting followers of each tradition to acknowledge their common belief in one God.

2. **Prophetic Tradition**: 
   - Prophets play a central role in all three texts. Figures like **Abraham, Moses, and David** are revered across the Tanach, New Testament, and Qur’an. These prophets serve as conduits of divine guidance and uphold justice, righteousness, and mercy, emphasizing universal values that are not confined to one faith tradition.
   - This reverence for shared prophets highlights a **moral and spiritual lineage** that connects the three religions and demonstrates their mutual commitment to ethical and spiritual ideals.

3. **Messianic Expectations**:
   - Each text contains references to a **messianic figure** or a savior. In Christianity, Jesus is seen as the Messiah, a role affirmed in the Qur’an, though with different theological nuances. Similarly, the Tanach contains messianic prophecies, particularly in the books of Isaiah and Daniel, that foretell the coming of a future leader. This shared expectation of a savior points to a deep-seated common hope within all three religions for divine intervention and renewal.

### Cultural and Social Significance
The connections among these scriptures offer more than theological insights; they present **opportunities for mutual understanding and cultural bridge-building**:

1. **Fostering Empathy and Reducing Fear**:
   - By emphasizing the commonalities in language, themes, and religious practices, we can help dispel misunderstandings and suspicions between the Muslim East and the Judeo-Christian West. Recognizing these shared values and beliefs can shift focus from differences to **common ethical principles** like peace, compassion, and justice.
  
2. **Promoting Interfaith Dialogue**:
   - Shared vocabulary and scriptural themes can facilitate **constructive conversations** between members of different faith communities. These dialogues not only deepen mutual respect but also highlight the ways these religions can collectively address social issues, such as poverty, violence, and inequality, by drawing on their common teachings.

3. **Encouraging Historical and Cultural Literacy**:
   - Understanding the shared linguistic heritage and similar theological concepts among the Tanach, New Testament, and Qur’an encourages **greater literacy in religious history**. By learning about the ancient Aramaic influences on the Qur’an and New Testament, believers and scholars alike can appreciate the dynamic and interconnected history of these traditions.

### Conclusion
The speech invites readers to consider how much the three Abrahamic faiths have in common, both linguistically and theologically. In an increasingly polarized world, recognizing these shared roots and common values could offer a path toward unity, fostering a spirit of collaboration rather than division. By re-emphasizing the mutual respect for one God, the value of prophetic teachings, and universal ethical principles, these shared scriptures can help bridge divides and serve as a foundation for peace and mutual respect.
